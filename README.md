# AniColors App

## App presentation

Hi!
So, this App aim is to provide the user an easy way to see how other animals see.

For now, it will just let the user choose among a couple of non-human animals (nha) and will show the comparison between human and non-human vision. That is, the App will have a database with some pre-loaded images - a specific pair of images for each nha (one image of the pair showing the human vision and the other the non-human vision) - and, when the user chooses the nha, that specific pair of images will be get and loaded to the frontend.

## Nice-to-have features

### Goals for the middle-near future

Create a form through which the user can upload their image and "filter" it through a non-human animal vision/view of their choice.

### Utopias

The App should intervene directly on devices' camera filters in order to immediately filter camera view and let the user see through their device what a chosen nha would see.
